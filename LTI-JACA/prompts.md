```
Prioritize features based on user needs and market demands
```

Certainly. Let's prioritize the features of LTI-ATS-JACA based on user needs and market demands.

The Could Have features can be developed to enhance the product's appeal and competitiveness but aren't critical for the initial launch. The Won't Have features are out of scope for now but could be considered for future versions as the product evolves and expands its capabilities.

This prioritization should be reviewed regularly and adjusted based on user feedback, market trends, and competitive landscape changes.

Would you like to discuss the rationale behind any specific prioritization or explore how to implement these features in phases?

Admins manage user permissions and implement data protection policies. Security officers perform security audits and monitor system access. All users interact with the system, which applies these security measures to protect their data and actions.

These diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the core functionalities for each Must Have feature in LTI-ATS-JACA, following UML syntax and best practices.

```
Create an Entity Relationship Diagram for the "Must Have" features using Mermaid, following the best practices for UML syntax. Include the field names and field types required for each entity.
```

Certainly! I'll create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the "Must Have" features of LTI-ATS-JACA using Mermaid syntax. This diagram will include the main entities, their relationships, and key fields with their types.

```mermaid

```

Description of the ERD:

1. User: Represents system users (recruiters, hiring managers, admins).
2. JobRequisition: Stores information about job openings.
3. Candidate: Contains details of job applicants.
4. Application: Represents a candidate's application for a specific job.
5. Interview: Stores interview details for applications.
6. ScreeningQuestion: Contains screening questions associated with job requisitions.
7. Communication: Tracks all communications with candidates.
8. Report: Stores generated reports.
9. EEOData: Contains Equal Employment Opportunity data for candidates.

Key relationships:
- Users create JobRequisitions and manage Candidates.
- JobRequisitions receive multiple Applications.
- Candidates submit multiple Applications.
- Applications can lead to multiple Interviews.
- ScreeningQuestions belong to JobRequisitions.
- EEOData belongs to Candidates.

This ERD covers the core entities required for the "Must Have" features of LTI-ATS-JACA. It provides a foundation for database design, showing the main tables and their relationships. The diagram includes primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK) to illustrate table connections.

Note that in a full implementation, you might need additional tables or fields, and some relationships might be more complex (e.g., many-to-many relationships might require junction tables). Also, consider adding indexes on frequently queried fields for performance optimization.

```
Following the industry best practices, select the tech stack that best fits the LTI-ATS-JACA product/system, and design the system architecture, creating a system architecture diagram using Mermaid and its description.
```

Certainly! I'll select a tech stack that best fits LTI-ATS-JACA based on industry best practices and design a system architecture accordingly. Then, I'll create a system architecture diagram using Mermaid and provide a description.

Tech Stack Selection:

1. Frontend: React.js with TypeScript
2. Backend: Node.js with Express.js
3. Database: PostgreSQL
4. Caching: Redis
5. Search Engine: Elasticsearch
6. Message Queue: RabbitMQ
7. Container Orchestration: Kubernetes
8. CI/CD: GitLab CI/CD
9. Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana
10. Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
11. API Gateway: Kong
12. Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
13. Cloud Provider: AWS

This tech stack is chosen for its scalability, performance, and robust ecosystem support.

Now, let's create a system architecture diagram using Mermaid:

```mermaid

    subgraph Client
        A[Web Browser]
        B[Mobile App]

```

System Architecture Description:

1. Client Layer: Users interact with the system through web browsers or mobile apps. The frontend is built with React.js and TypeScript for a responsive and type-safe user interface.

2. Content Delivery Network (CDN): AWS CloudFront is used to serve static assets globally, reducing latency for users.

3. Load Balancer: AWS Elastic Load Balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of the application servers.

4. API Gateway: Kong serves as the API gateway, handling routing, rate limiting, and API versioning.

5. Web Server: Nginx acts as a reverse proxy and handles SSL termination.

6. Application Servers: Node.js with Express.js powers the backend, running in containers orchestrated by Kubernetes for scalability and easy management.

7. Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with JWT is used for secure authentication and authorization.

8. Message Queue: RabbitMQ handles asynchronous tasks and ensures system resilience.

9. Caching: Redis is used for caching frequently accessed data, improving performance.

10. Search Engine: Elasticsearch provides fast and efficient full-text search capabilities.

11. Databases: PostgreSQL serves as the primary relational database for structured data storage.

12. Storage: AWS S3 is used for storing files such as resumes and other documents.

13. Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus and Grafana are used for real-time monitoring and visualization of system metrics. The ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) is used for centralized logging and log analysis.

14. CI/CD: GitLab CI/CD is used for continuous integration and deployment, automating the build, test, and deployment processes.

15. Container Orchestration: Kubernetes manages the deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts.

This architecture is designed to be scalable, resilient, and maintainable. It leverages cloud services (AWS) for infrastructure, uses containers for consistency across environments, and implements modern DevOps practices for efficient development and operations.

The system is built with microservices architecture in mind, allowing for independent scaling and development of different components. The use of message queues and caching helps in handling high loads and improving response times. The inclusion of monitoring and logging systems ensures that the operations team can quickly identify and resolve any issues that arise.

This architecture provides a solid foundation for LTI-ATS-JACA, allowing it to handle the complexities of a modern ATS while providing room for future growth and feature additions.

```
Let's create the C4 diagrams for LIT-ATS-JACA, considering the given tech stack, system architecture, and "Must Have" priorities.

Provide the diagrams using both Mermeid code.

If you have any questions, ask me.
```

Certainly! I'll create the C4 diagrams for LTI-ATS-JACA, considering the given tech stack, system architecture, and "Must Have" priorities. I'll provide both PlantUML and Mermaid code for each diagram. We'll create three levels of C4 diagrams: Context, Container, and Component.

Let's start with the Context Diagram:

    classDef system_boundary fill:#ffffff,stroke:#444444,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    classDef component fill:#85BBF0
```

These C4 diagrams provide a comprehensive view of the LTI-ATS-JACA system at different levels of abstraction:

1. The Context Diagram shows the system's interactions with users and external systems.
2. The Container Diagram breaks down the system into its main components and shows their interactions.
3. The Component Diagram focuses on the Application Server, showing its internal components and their relationships.

These diagrams align with the given tech stack, system architecture, and "Must Have" priorities, providing a clear visualization of the system's structure and interactions.

```
Let's create the C4 Code diagrams for the following components:

- Job Controller
- Application Controller
- Interview Controller
- User Controller

Each component should include diagrams for:
- Interaction Diagram
- Sequence Diagram
- Class Diagram

The diagrams must be implemented using Mermaid and following the best UML practices.

These diagrams provide a comprehensive view of the structure and interactions within each controller component of the LTI-ATS-JACA system. They follow UML best practices and use Mermaid syntax for easy integration into documentation.
