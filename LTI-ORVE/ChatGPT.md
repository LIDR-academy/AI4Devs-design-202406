Let's analize an ATS (applicant Tracking tool) just like Indeed, monday, rippling. I attached an image of the fases of a ATS.
ChatGPT
Let me first take a look at the image you uploaded to understand the phases of the ATS. I'll load and analyze the image.

It seems that the image format is not supported for direct display. Let's try converting the image to a different format to analyze its content. ​​

It seems the AVIF format is causing issues with the conversion process. Let's try a different approach to extract the necessary information from the image.

Please provide a brief description or list of the phases depicted in the image so I can help you analyze the ATS phases effectively. ​​
