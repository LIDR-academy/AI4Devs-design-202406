This Lean Canvas provides a comprehensive overview of the key elements required to develop and implement LTI Recruit, ensuring it addresses the critical needs of the market while leveraging the best practices from existing ATS systems.



## Brief description of main 3 use cases

Certainly, here are the top three use cases for the LTI Recruit system, represented in a more simplified and understandable UML diagram.

### Top 3 Use Cases for LTI Recruit

```plantuml
@startuml

actor Recruiter
actor HiringManager
actor Candidate

usecase "Create Job Posting" as UC1

Recruiter -> UC2 : "Reviews"
Recruiter -> UC3 : "Schedules"

HiringManager -> UC2 : "Reviews"
HiringManager -> UC3 : "Schedules"

### Explanation of the Top 3 Use Cases:

1. **Create Job Posting**:

    - **Description**: Recruiters and hiring managers schedule interviews with shortlisted candidates. Candidates attend the scheduled interviews.

These use cases cover the critical steps in the recruitment process, ensuring that the key functionalities of job creation, application review, and interview scheduling are efficiently handled.

### Database model on mermaid

Sure, as a software architect, I can provide a database model that supports the three top use cases: creating job postings, reviewing applications, and scheduling interviews. Below is the database model using Mermaid syntax.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    RECRUITER {
        int id PK
        string name
        string email
        string phone
    }

    HIRING_MANAGER {
        int id PK
        string name
        string email
        string phone
    }

    CANDIDATE {
        int id PK
        string name
        string email
        string phone
        text resume
    }

    JOB_POSTING {
        int id PK
        int recruiter_id FK
        string title
        string description
        string requirements
        date created_at
        date updated_at
    }

    APPLICATION {
        int id PK
        int job_posting_id FK
        int candidate_id FK
        date applied_at
        string status
    }

    INTERVIEW {
        int id PK
        int application_id FK
        int recruiter_id FK
        int hiring_manager_id FK
        date interview_date
        string interview_mode
        string interview_status
    }

    RECRUITER ||--o{ JOB_POSTING : creates
    JOB_POSTING ||--o{ APPLICATION : has
    CANDIDATE ||--o{ APPLICATION : submits
    RECRUITER ||--o{ INTERVIEW : schedules
    HIRING_MANAGER ||--o{ INTERVIEW : schedules
